# Installation

You can get the stable version of genkey through the releases
page, or get the latest development versions by building it from source.

## Releases - Stable

1.  Head over to [the GitHub releases
    page](https://github.com/semilin/genkey/releases) and download the
    latest file for your respective operating system.
2.  Unzip the file.
3.  You're ready to go!

## From Source - Latest

1.  Make sure that you have the [Go programming
    language](https://golang.org/) installed. For Windows or Mac, you
    can get it at [the official downloads
    page](https://golang.org/dl/).  For Linux, you should get it from
    your distribution's package manager, as "go" or "golang".
2.  Make sure that you have git installed. Though you *can* just
    download a zip file, keeping your layouts and weights through
    updates is much more convenient through git. If you're using
    windows, get it from
    [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/). If you're using
    MacOS, it's already installed. If you're using Linux, you most
    likely already have it; if not, get it from your distribution's
    package manager.
3.  Open a terminal. If you're on Windows, you can use the Git BASH
    program that you may have downloaded in step 2.
4.  Clone the repo with
    `git clone https://github.com/semilin/genkey`{.verbatim}
5.  Enter the directory with `cd genkey`{.verbatim}
6.  Compile the program with `go build`{.verbatim}. This shouldn't take
    too long.
7.  You're ready to go!
