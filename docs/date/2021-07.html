<p>The Semimak layout is designed to have low finger movement rate -
decreasing the overall speed at which your fingers must travel to type
on average. This doesnâ€™t only mean to optimize for reducing
same-finger bigrams (e.g <code>ed</code> on QWERTY), but disjointeds as well
(e.g the <code>m_y</code> in <code>may</code> on QWERTY). Semimak was the pioneer of DSFB
and weighted finger dexterity.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>

<p>I created my own analyzer,
<a href="https://github.com/semilin/genkey" >genkey</a>, to put my ideas into
effect. At the time, it was only made for myself, and was difficult to
use. However, many people have used it since then, creating their own
layouts with it, and it has been massively improved since its
creation. If you're interested in analyzing layouts, or creating your
own, give it a shot!</p>

<h2>Finger Speed</h2>

<p>Most layout analyzers at the moment report an SFB percentage - how
many times you use the same finger to hit two keys in a row. But I
found this somewhat superficial - not all SFBs are equally bad. They
can be heavily influenced by what finger is being used and how much
distance is traveled in the SFB. In addition, the statistic can be
generalized more. Why do the two keys in the bigram need to be
concurrent to be significant?</p>

<h2>Skipgrams</h2>

<p>Instead of only punishing same-finger bigrams weighted by finger
and distance, I had the idea to also punish same-finger
skipgrams. I weighted this exponentially - separated by 0 keys
(normal bigram) is a weight of 1, separated by 1 is half as bad,
separated by 2 is a quarter, and so on. These weights are
arbitrary, but they were inspired both by the experiences of both
myself and typists much faster than me.</p>

<h2>Distance weighting</h2>

<p>I weighted the distance between keys exponentially, as I think a
distance of 2 units is much worse than a distance of 1
unit. Layouts like Workman and Colemak DH have shown the discomfort
that can be cause with lateral index movement - because of this,
lateral movement was treated worse in my analyzer.</p>

<h2>Finger weighting</h2>

<p>I used a basic script that <a href="https://github.com/notgate" >NotGate</a> wrote
to test how quickly I can move each of my fingers. For example, to see
how dexterous my middle finger is, I would type eded over and over on
QWERTY, and see how fast my keys per second was. This data was then
used to weight how bad fast distance is on each finger.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>The layout was scored by genkey largely with the weighted finger
movement speed metric. There was also some reward for rolling, and
penalty for redirects.</p>

<p>However, what the generator created had an extremely high redirect
rate, and so I swapped the columns around at the end to increase
alternation. Though I am no alternation lover, the redirect rate
would have really been <em>way</em> too much.</p>
