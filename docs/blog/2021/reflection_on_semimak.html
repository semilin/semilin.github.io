On July 1st 2021, 12:00 P.M PDT, Semimak was released.
<a href="https://github.com/notgate">NotGate</a> and I held a tournament with an
$850 prize pool, and over 200 people participated in it (including me,
just for fun). I got a lot of feedback from this!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-problems" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-problems">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:07793965-ec56-407c-80b4-bdbbab699c0e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:07793965-ec56-407c-80b4-bdbbab699c0e">Right Index Finger</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:07793965-ec56-407c-80b4-bdbbab699c0e">
<p>
Despite the relatively low usage of the right index finger, some people
had difficulty with it. It is the finger with the highest unweighted
movement, but that's difficult to avoid, considering the index fingers
have double the responsibility of a normal finger.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:6d89011a-bad2-4fb7-a6ad-7f4f8cddf286" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:6d89011a-bad2-4fb7-a6ad-7f4f8cddf286">Ring Finger Movements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:6d89011a-bad2-4fb7-a6ad-7f4f8cddf286">
<p>
This seemed to be the biggest issue people had with the layout overall.
<code>lr'</code> and <code>oa.</code> columns will cause a lot of movement, and the ring
fingers are either the slowest or second slowest fingers for people.
</p>

<p>
This highlights a very interesting effect of relative dexterity. I
personally never had any issue with it, which is unsurprising
considering I made the layout adapted to my own finger speed. I believed
at the time that people could adapt to comfort with this, like I was
able to with my pinkies. However, although almost everyone was able to
adapt comfortably to the pinky movement, a not insignificant amount of
people struggled with the ring fingers.
</p>

<p>
I now believe that I am simply lucky to have more dexterous ring fingers
than average. This would have been difficult for me to know at the time,
since no layouts that I had known of at the time had really pushed the
limits on the ring fingers. Regardless, this was my biggest oversight
with Semimak.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:83c402b9-35dc-46ed-9b74-61b50d15d4d0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:83c402b9-35dc-46ed-9b74-61b50d15d4d0"><code>'r</code> and <code>'ll</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:83c402b9-35dc-46ed-9b74-61b50d15d4d0">
<p>
This is one of the more specific egregious problems with Semimak. Words
like <code>you're</code>, <code>you'll</code>, and <code>I'll</code> are abyssmal on the layout because
they include bad SFBs on the left ring finger. Though they can pretty
easily be alt-fingered, I still found them quite problematic. Because of
this, I created my own mod, Semimak JQ, about 2 months after its
original release.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd28cad1">
f l h v z  ' w u o y
s r n t k  c d e a i
x j b m q  p g , . /
</pre>

<p>
It only makes two swaps, a 3 key cycle, so it is quite easy to learn
from the original layout. After about a month of using it full-time, I
can confidently say that it's pretty much objectively better than the
reference layout, at least for me.

<div id="outline-container-successses" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="successses">Successes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-successses">
<p>
By the end of the one month tournament, over 5 people had gotten above
100 wpm with the layout on a very difficult typing test - top 10k
English words, random punctuation, and 2 minutes. This is really
impressive!
</p>

<p>
However, the more interesting thing is to watch their handcams (for
example, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hu1whMOKR2M?t=34">Octahedron's</a>; the fingers look just as low movement as the
layout set out to be. This is a great success, because it validates my
theory of finger movement. This feels accurate for me as well, even at
over 160 wpm on Semimak, my fingers feel like they are moving very
slowly, especially when compared to other alt layouts.
</p>

<p>
Today, there are still quite a few using Semimak, several of which can
type over 160 wpm on a basic 60 second test. For the people who Semimak
works for, it seems to work really well.

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-takeaways">
<p>
Overall, Semimak was a very novel layout. It was the first of its kind,
and because of that was extremely different from most layouts at the
time, and was overall a risky move.
</p>

<p>
Semimak did have its shortcomings, and it isn't for everyone. But I
think it's fair enough to say that it did spark a new paradigm for new
layouts to be made in the style of. The design behind Semimak has been
an inspiration for many new layouts created since.
</p>

<p>
So, though I don't think that everyone should learn Semimak, it is 100%
a great success to me. And I could not have done it without the
wonderful, welcoming, and unfathomably nerdy layout community, who
encouraged and inspired me immensely. Thank you all!
