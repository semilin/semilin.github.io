The Semimak layout is designed to have low finger movement rate -
decreasing the overall speed at which your fingers must travel to type
on average. This doesnâ€™t only mean to optimize for reducing
same-finger bigrams (e.g <kbd>ed</kbd> on QWERTY),
but disjointeds as well (e.g the <kbd>m y</kbd> in
<kbd>may</kbd> on QWERTY). Semimak was the pioneer of
DSFB and weighted finger dexterity.

<p>
I created my own analyzer, <a href="https:github.com/semilin/genkey">genkey</a>, to put my ideas into
effect. At the time, it was only made for myself, and was difficult to
use. However, many people have used it since then, creating their own
layouts with it, and it has been massively improved since its
creation. If you're interested in analyzing layouts, or creating your
own, give it a shot!

<h3 id="org6116236">Finger Speed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6116236">
<p>
Most layout analyzers at the moment report an SFB percentage - how
many times you use the same finger to hit two keys in a row. But I
found this somewhat superficial - not all SFBs are equally bad. They
can be heavily influenced by what finger is being used and how much
distance is traveled in the SFB. In addition, the statistic can be
generalized more. Why do the two keys in the bigram need to be
concurrent to be significant?

<h3 id="orgfcd4c44">Skipgrams</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfcd4c44">
<p>
Instead of only punishing same-finger bigrams weighted by finger
and distance, I had the idea to also punish same-finger
skipgrams. I weighted this exponentially - separated by 0 keys
(normal bigram) is a weight of 1, separated by 1 is half as bad,
separated by 2 is a quarter, and so on. These weights are
arbitrary, but they were inspired both by the experiences of both
myself and typists much faster than me.

<h3 id="org7dd31fd">Distance weighting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7dd31fd">
<p>
I weighted the distance between keys exponentially, as I think a
distance of 2 units is much worse than a distance of 1
unit. Layouts like Workman and Colemak DH have shown the discomfort
that can be cause with lateral index movement - because of this,
lateral movement was treated worse in my analyzer.

<p>
I used a basic script that <a href="https://github.com/notgate">NotGate</a> wrote to test how quickly I can
move each of my fingers. For example, to see how dexterous my middle
finger is, I would type eded over and over on QWERTY, and see how fast
my keys per second was. This data was then used to weight how bad fast
distance is on each finger.

<h3 id="orgddda7b1">Scoring</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgddda7b1">
<p>
The layout was scored by genkey largely with the weighted finger
movement speed metric. There was also some reward for rolling, and
penalty for redirects.
</p>

<p>
However, what the generator created had an extremely high redirect
rate, and so I swapped the columns around at the end to increase
alternation. Though I am no alternation lover, the redirect rate
would have really been <span class="underline">way</span> too much.
