<p>In less than a year of using Semimak, I hit 200 words per minute on it.
On my previous layouts the highest I had gotten was 160 wpm, so this is
a big achievement for me. It also means that I'm the first and only
person to have achieved 200 wpm on their own layout<img src="NIL" alt="^1" /> Given this
milestone, I thought I should write a little bit about my experience
getting here and my final thoughts on the layout.</p>

<p>Semimak is a great layout... well, for me at least! This definitely
makes sense, given it was designed around problems that I identified
with <em>my experience</em> in other layouts, and it was closely modeled around
my personal finger dexterity. If there is anything we should be able to
agree on in keyboard layouts, it's that what is &quot;good&quot; is entirely
subjective. People have different hands. They have different ideas of
what is comfortable, and different physical limits. My ring and pinky
fingers are more capable than many, while my middle fingers can be
considered pretty slow. Therefore, it's likely that my layout won't be
the best experience for a lot of people, despite being great for me!</p>

<p>This idea probably could have been communicated better given that in
August of 2020, we held a month-long tournament with an $850 prize pool
to see who could learn the layout the fastest.<a href="2" >^2</a> This likely gave many
people the impression that Semimak was the &quot;best layout&quot;, despite such
a thing, of course, not existing. <strong>Be skeptical of anyone who claims
their layout to be &quot;objectively&quot; better than other layouts.</strong> I will
not name names, but if someone claims that their layout has 130% higher
&quot;efficiency&quot; than another layout, they probably don't know what
they're talking about. And it's not a meaningful metric that you
should pay attention to.</p>

<p>To me, Semimak is the best example in proving that layout quality is
subjective. I love the layout, and truly think that no other layout
currently in existence is better for me. There are several other people
who still use and like the layout too - notably, Fenno has over 220 wpm
on the layout<img src="NIL" alt="^3" /> However, there were many people during the tournament
who did not like the layout. It was uncomfortable for them, unintuitive,
or physically the layout was just too much from them.</p>

<p>&quot;But the <a href="https://semilin.github.io/genkey" >analyzer</a> said it was
better than every other layout!&quot; Yeah, of course it did. If you make an
analyzer optimize a layout for certain metrics, it's going to do better
than other layouts in those metrics. <strong>What matters is not how well the
layout fits the metrics, it's how well the metrics fit you.</strong></p>

<p>The point of Semimak was to be novel. Based off my own experience, I saw
a hole in what kinds of things people and analyzers were looking for in
layouts. I wanted to add another way to think about layouts, and I
succeeded in doing that by making Semimak. I feel satisfied seeing
people talk about dSFB, or same-finger skipgrams so frequently when
analyzing layouts these days. My work has definitely had some impact in the community, and I'm happy
about that.</p>

<p>Semimak, ultimately, is a proof of concept. It also happens to be a
pretty good layout, for the right kind of person.</p>

<p>If you take away anything from this post, it's that Dvorak is the most
perfect layout ever created and everybody should switch to it right n</p>
