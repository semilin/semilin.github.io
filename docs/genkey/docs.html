<h2 id="org4a8504c">Basic Usage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4a8504c">
<p>
Genkey is a command line tool. This means that you perform actions
by running the binary through the terminal.
</p>

<p>
The binary is called <code>genkey.exe</code> on Windows, or simply <code>genkey</code> on
Linux or MacOS. From now on, the binary will just be referred to as
<code>genkey</code>, so if you're using Windows, make sure to correct it. Also
note that you can autocomplete with TAB, in the likely case that you
don't want to type out the full name every time.
</p>

<p>
The general format of commands looks like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">./genkey COMMAND ARGUMENT
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05c62ce" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org05c62ce">Layouts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org05c62ce">
<p>
Layouts are stored as basic text files in the <code>layouts</code>
subdirectory. Here is an example of its format, using the
unholy layout as reference.
</p>
<pre class="example">
QWERTY
q w e r t y u i o p [ ] \
a s d f g h j k l ; '
z x c v b n m , . /
0 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6 7 7 7 7
0 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6 7 7
0 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6 7 
</pre>

<p>
The first line is used as the name of the layout - the name of the
file is <b>not</b> used by the program. Note that if two files have the
same layout name, only one will show up; the program will output
no error if this happens, so make sure that you rename it!
</p>

<p>
The next block of lines is the layout itself. This is pretty much
self-explanatory. However, at the moment genkey only supports 3
rows, adding more will confuse it.
</p>

<p>
The final block defines what finger is used to hit each key. Each
finger, not including thumbs, is a digit from 0 to 7. Left pinky is
0, right pinky is 7, and everything in between follows the order you
would expect. Thumb keys are not supported in genkey, but <a href="https://github.com/apsu/genkey">Apsu's
fork</a> does add experimental support.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf594cdb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf594cdb">_generate</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf594cdb">
<p>
The <code>_generate</code> layout file is used to define the fingermap for
layouts created with the generate function. In addition, the main
key block can be used to pin keys for the improve function. Free
keys are labeled with <code>*</code>, and pinned keys are labeled with <code>X</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdcfee54" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdcfee54">Weighting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdcfee54">
<p>
The weights that determine how layouts are scored is configured in
<code>weights.hjson</code>. Though the base weights are made to be an okay
starting point, you are intended to experiment with them and
shape them to your liking.
</p>

<p>
The "score" is a very arbitrary number that should not be considered
an actual indicator of a layout's "objective" quality. The score is
calculated from the user's approximations of their personal
preferences. Anything that comes from personal preference can't be
objective, so do not treat it as such. Beating some layout's score
is great, but that doesn't mean it's actually better.
</p>

<p>
Note: higher score is worse, lower score is better.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4329fdf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4329fdf">Distance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4329fdf">
<p>
This is the way to calculate distance between any two given keys
on a layout.
</p>

<p>
Where \(l\) is the lateral movement multiplier, the expression for weighted
distance is as follows:
</p>

   \begin{equation}
(l \times \Delta{x}^2) + (\Delta{y}^2)
   \end{equation}

<p>
This is the formula for distance, except not square rooted as to
treat distance exponentially.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9ae7e8a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9ae7e8a">Finger Speed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9ae7e8a">
<p>
At a high level, finger speed is basically just looking at bigrams
and skipgrams with an adaptation of the rate equation:
</p>
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{d}{n}
\end{equation}

<p>
\(d\) is the distance between the two keys (see
<a href="#org4329fdf">Distance</a>). \(n\) is the 'length' of the skip-gram, or how the
distance between characters in the sequence. For a bigram, \(n\)
is 1. For a skip-1-gram, (e.g. <code>t_e</code> in <code>the</code>) \(n\) is 2.
</p>

<p>
This equation effectively results in a time required to move a
finger from one key to another. Finger speed as a metric
is the average of all these times.
</p>

<p>
However, in reality there are more factors that affect this
time. Namely, different fingers differ greatly in how fast they can
be moved. Because of this, genkey has a KPS array, which defines
how dexterous each finger is. KPS stands for "keys per second",
which is what the numbers were originally based on.
</p>

<p>
In addition, though it would theoretically work out that a
skip-1-gram has exactly twice the time to travel as a bigram,
some people care about skipgrams less than others. Because of this,
genkey allows you to weight it.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Also, a KeyTravel weight is provided, which can help avoid the
problem of double letters (e.g. "oo") having 0 distance, and thus
not being counted at all. It's used as a baseline value for
distance.
</p>

<p>
Considering these factors, the equation for a pair of keys ends up
more like the following (where \(k\) is key travel, \(F\) is the
finger's dexterity, and \(c\) is the count of how many times the
pair appears):
</p>

   \begin{equation}
r=c \times \frac{(d+k)\times F}{n}
   \end{equation}

<p>
Genkey then gets the average time all of these same-finger
pairs. The lower that this metric is, the better. Though the
original idea for this was to be able to calculate how fast your
fingers need to move to maintain a given wpm, (hence the name) it
is in reality much more complicated than this. It's still a very
useful metric, but take it with a grain of salt.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org71edb38" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org71edb38">Index Balance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71edb38">
<p>
This is a very simple metric that punishes one index finger being
used much more than the other. It's just the expression \(|l-r|\)
where \(l\) and \(r\) are left and right index usage
respectively. Increasing the weight increases its addition to the
score.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0c578b2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0c578b2">LSB</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0c578b2">
<p>
LSB stands for Lateral Stretch Bigram. It refers to any adjacent
finger bigram where \(\Delta x \ge 2\). This typically is used to
mean bigrams between index and middle fingers, but genkey also
includes pinky and ring in this calculation. More is worse, so
increasing the weight value increases how much it affects the
score.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5d7e88f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5d7e88f">Trigrams</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5d7e88f">
<p>
Genkey uses trigrams to calculate rolls, alternation, redirects,
and onehand rolls.
</p>

<p>
The TrigramPrecision value determines how many of the most common
trigrams are used for this calculation. Since there are far more
trigrams than SFBs, the calculation slows down generation a lot, so
you probably don't want to use all of them. However, if you do, you
can set the value to 0. Otherwise, setting the value to -1 disables
the calculation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga28671c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga28671c">Rolls</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga28671c">
<p>
Rolls are defined as 2 (not-same-finger) keys typed on one hand,
following or preceding 1 key pressed on the other. An inward roll
is where the direction of the 2 keys on the same hand approaches
the index, whereas an outward roll approaches the pinky. Since
rolls are generally desired, they subtract from the score.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdf877b3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgdf877b3">Alternation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdf877b3">
<p>
Alternates are defined as trigrams where each key in the sequence
switches hands. Since alternation is generally desired, it
subtracts from the score.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1e44b4f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1e44b4f">Redirects</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1e44b4f">
<p>
Redirects are defined as trigrams where all keys are on the same
hand, but they do not all follow the same direction. For example,
<code>sfd</code> would be a redirect on QWERTY, because the direction of <code>sf</code>
is inward, but the direction of <code>fd</code> is outward. Since redirects
are generally undesired, they add to the score. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org53f2faa" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org53f2faa">Onehands</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org53f2faa">
<p>
Onehand rolls are defined as trigrams where all keys are on the
same, and they all follow the same direction. For example, <code>sdf</code>
on QWERTY would be a onehand roll. Since onehands are generally
desired, they subtract from the score.

<p>
Generate simply creates a new layout, and tries to minimize

significantly increases the time. Otherwise, how long it takes is
probably most dependent on your CPU's multicore efficiency.

When semi came up with the finger speed concept, they coined the
term "disjointed bigram". Though a fancy sounding name, skipgram is an
already existing term that fits better. Despite this, DSFB
("disjointed same-finger bigram") is still used relatively frequently,
which is why it's called that in genkey.
