1. Make sure that you have the [[https://golang.org/][Go programming
   language]] installed. For Windows or Mac, you can get it at [[https://golang.org/dl/][the
   official downloads page]]. For Linux, you should get it from your
   distribution's package manager, as "go" or "golang".
2. Make sure that you have git installed. Though you /can/ just download
   a zip file, keeping your layouts and weights through updates is much
   more convenient through git. If you're using windows, get it from
   [[https://gitforwindows.org/][gitforwindows.org]]. If you're using
   MacOS, it's already installed. If you're using Linux, you most likely
   already have it; if not, get it from your distribution's package
   manager.
3. Open a terminal. If you're on Windows, you can use the Git BASH
   program that you may have downloaded in step 2.
4. Clone the repo with ~git clone https://github.com/semilin/genkey~
5. Enter the directory with ~cd genkey~
6. Compile the program with ~go build~. This shouldn't take too long.
7. You're ready to go!
