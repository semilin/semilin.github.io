Hi, I'm semi. I write mediocre code in Common Lisp and Rust, and spend
too much time thinking about keyboard layouts.

** Keymeow
Keymeow is a Rust library for layout analysis using the low-level
[[https://github.com/semilin/keycat][keycat]] library. It supports shift keys, combos, and layers, all
through extremely flexible metric definition. [[https://github.com/semilin/keymui][Keymui]] is the GUI
frontend for Keymeow.
** [[file:genkey/index.org][genkey]]
genkey is a keyboard layout analyzer I wrote to make Semimak. It
pioneered analysis of same-finger skipgrams.
